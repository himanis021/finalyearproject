function meansOut = kmean(img,means)
% performs one step of the k-means clustering algorithm on a binary image
% with an initial guess of input mean values
% 
%       input arguments:
%   img         - mxn binary image
%   means       - px2 array with each row representing the row and column value
%                 of each initial cluster average guess

%       output:
%   meansOut    - output mean results after one iteration of the k-means
%                 algorithm
