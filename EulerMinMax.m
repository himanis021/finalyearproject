% This function extract a binary image from gray scale image
% using auto-tuned threshold value obtained from the correlation
% of Image euler numbers. This work had been published in

%
% c is the binary image output from the calculation 
% i is the input Gray Scale Image (E.g unit8 image)
% b is then number of level used to calculate the threshold (E.g 255)
%
% Example:
% a = imread('case1_pa_wo.tif');
% c = eulerminmax(a,255); 
% imshow(c);
%
% This function works for Matlab 7.0 with bweuler() and histeq() function
% from Image Processing Toolbox. No further validation for other version. 
%
% maximum number of diffrent eular number and min no of eular matrix should
% be devided by image dimension , that have to consider in figure 5 as in
% content based image position
